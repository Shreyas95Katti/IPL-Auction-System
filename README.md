# IPL Auction Automation Project
Welcome to the IPL Auction Automation Project!

# Overview
The goal of this project is to entirely automate the IPL auction process. We have a dataset with 56 players and information on their cricket careers thus far, including details such as name, age, runs scored, wickets taken, and more. To simplify the process, the number of bidders is limited to three.

# Accessibility
## Admin Features:
1. Create a new player list
2. Inspect the player list
3. Add a new player
4. Remove an existing player
5. Edit data about a specific player

## User Features:
1. Participate in the bidding
2. Check the list of players up for auction
3. View the players secured in their team

## Auction Process
1. Player Presentation: Each player from the main list is shown one by one.
2. Bidding: Users can call their team number to raise the bid over the initial price.
3. Securing Players: The side that continues to bid to the end will secure the player. All users can cease bidding at any time during the process.
4. Automation: The whole automation is built on basic logical flow and file management principles.

Run the make file to start the auction stage and have fun bidding!

# Future Iteration: Team-Based Player Management
The next iteration of the system will include team-based player management. Each club must input the players it has acquired for further management, utilizing Linked Lists and other DSA concepts.

## Team Manager Features:
1. Add players
2. Inspect the player list
3. Create a new list
4. Delete players
5. Update players

The file management system employed here is effective, making the process of auction and team management very easy and efficient.

# Versatility
This project is not only focused on the IPL; it has been designed in such a way that it could be used for other sports too, with just a few simple small tweaks.

Enjoy the seamless experience of automated auctions and efficient team management!
